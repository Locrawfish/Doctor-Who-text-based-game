 # Taking the Long Way Round

 ###This repo contains the beginning of a text-based game based on the penultimate episode of the ninth series of Doctor Who episode, "Heaven Sent", where the Doctor finds himself transported to a waterlocked castle with a vieled monster seeking to kill him (thanks Steven Moffat). 

###In this game, you are the doctor in search for room 12. As you move through the castle, you will find numbered rooms that are locked. To unlock a room you must answer a question; if you answer it correctly, you will get a hint as to where room 12 is. If you answer incorrectly the door will not open and you must move on. 

###Have fun and good luck!

As you come into this world, something else is also born. You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. It moves slowly, but it never stops. Whatever path you take, it will follow - never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run, it will walk. You will rest, it will not. One day, you will linger in the same place too long, you will sit too still, you will sleep too deep. And when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then be over.
