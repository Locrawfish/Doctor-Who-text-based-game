 #Taking the Long Way Round

This repo contains the beginning of a text-based game based on the penultimate episode of the ninth series of Doctor Who episode, "Heaven Sent", where the Doctor finds himself transported to a waterlocked castle with a vieled monster seeking to kill him (thanks Steven Moffat). 

In this game, you are the doctor in search for room 12. As you move through the castle, you will find numbered rooms that are locked. To unlock a room you must answer a question; if you answer it correctly, you will get a hint as to where room 12 is. If you answer incorrectly the door will not open and you must move on. 

Have fun and good luck!
